Title: The Sleepy Star's Journey

Once upon a time, in a quiet corner of the night sky, lived a tiny star named Luma. Luma wasn’t the brightest or the fastest, but she had the kindest glow. Every night, she twinkled softly, hoping someone would notice her gentle light.

One evening, Luma looked down at Earth and saw a little girl named Tara trying to fall asleep. Tara tossed and turned in her bed, her mind buzzing with thoughts of the day. Seeing her struggle, Luma decided she would help.

With a shimmer and a giggle, Luma drifted closer to Earth. As she got near, the night air filled with a gentle hum — a lullaby only hearts could hear. Tara opened her eyes and saw the glowing star outside her window. Her eyes widened with wonder.

Luma whispered, “Close your eyes, little dreamer, and let’s go on a journey.” Tara, comforted by the glow, nodded and shut her eyes. In a flash, she found herself floating beside Luma in the sky, soaring past clouds, over mountains, and through silver streams of moonlight.

They visited sleepy owls perched on trees, swam with stardust dolphins in the Milky Way, and danced with glowing fireflies who lit up the sky like fairy lanterns. Tara laughed and felt lighter than air. The worries of the day melted away like morning mist.

As the adventure wound down, Luma brought Tara back to her room, her heart now calm and full. “Whenever you can’t sleep,” Luma whispered, “just look for my glow. I’ll be right here.” Tara smiled and drifted into the deepest, sweetest sleep she’d ever known.

And from then on, Luma twinkled a little brighter — not because she was the biggest star, but because she had given someone a dream.

The end.
